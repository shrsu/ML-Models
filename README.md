# ML Models

This repository contains all the machine learning models I’ve implemented while following the **Machine Learning A-Z: AI, Python & R + ChatGPT Prize \[2025]** course.

I’m using this repo to track my learning and practice, mainly in **Python**. The models include:

* Regression models
* Classification algorithms
* Clustering techniques
* Association rule learning
* Reinforcement learning
* Natural Language Processing
* Deep learning (ANNs, CNNs)
* Model evaluation and boosting methods

Each model is organized into its respective folder with code, datasets (if used), and notes where necessary.
